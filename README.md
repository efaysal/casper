#  This work is pre-peer-review
## Read at your own time-risk!

# To Do:
## Specification:
* better specification of "safe mode" is required
* pay a fee to top-up and to bond so that bonding is incentive-compatible
* weight validations in proportion to the size of the deposit
* target timeout period to make censorship unprofitable

## Traditional consensus/bft analysis:
* more rigor in analysis of the asynchronous case
* review from experts is probably required

## Economic analysis:
* do analysis of attacks that expel rational nodes by reducing their profitability

## Optional:
* add pretty diagrams/illustrations
* add decentralization/ mass-crash-fault recovery analysis
